# Vim Cheat Sheet
My personal cheat sheet for Vim

## Modes:
### Insert Mode:

```
i         # insert before the cursor (insert)
I         # insert at the beginning of the line
a         # insert after the cursor (append)
A         # insert at the end of the line
o         # open a new line below the current line (open)
O         # open a new line above the current line
C         # delete rest of the line from the cursor and enter insert mode
s         # delete character under the cursor and enter insert mode (substitute)
S         # delete current line and enter insert mode
Esc       # exit insert mode
```
